# Real-Time-Air-Quality-Prediction-with-Apache-Kafka
This project uses Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming and environmental time series analysis. Develop an end-to-end data pipeline using the UCI Air Quality dataset to demonstrate merit in streaming architecture, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling deployment.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains hourly air quality measurements from a gas multisensor device deployed on the field in an Italian city from March 2004 to February 2005.
- Features include: Date	(DD/MM/YYYY), Time	(HH.MM.SS), True hourly averaged concentration CO in mg/m^3  (reference analyzer), PT08.S1 (tin oxide)  hourly averaged sensor response (nominally  CO targeted), True hourly averaged overall Non Metanic HydroCarbons concentration in microg/m^3 (reference analyzer), True hourly averaged Benzene concentration  in microg/m^3 (reference analyzer), PT08.S2 (titania) hourly averaged sensor response (nominally NMHC targeted), True hourly averaged NOx concentration  in ppb (reference analyzer), PT08.S3 (tungsten oxide) hourly averaged sensor response (nominally NOx targeted), True hourly averaged NO2 concentration in microg/m^3 (reference analyzer), PT08.S4 (tungsten oxide) hourly averaged sensor response (nominally NO2 targeted), PT08.S5 (indium oxide) hourly averaged sensor response (nominally O3 targeted), Temperature in Â°C	, Relative Humidity (%), AH Absolute Humidity
